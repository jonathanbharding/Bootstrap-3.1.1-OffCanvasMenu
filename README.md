You can see the menu action in the [demo page](http://webedge.github.io/Bootstrap-3.1.1-OffCanvasMenu/demo).

## Usage

This module is dependent on using Bootstrap 3.1.1. I have not tested on lower 3.0.0. 

## Compiled and LESS versions

If you are not familiar with LESS there is a compiled.html file that links to the compiled CSS. It is also linking to the CDN version of bootstrap. If you are familiar with LESS, The main index.html file is pointed to the less compiled CSS
